# Shuttle Notes: basically pluto but with VERY VERY LIGHT ship weaponry and instead of cargo a boarding bay for them crimers. Also IFF, since it's basically mandatory for any sort of criminal.

  name: DIS Pluto
  description: A gross refitting of the classic Pluto done by the Paycheck Bravta, intended to be used as a fast, somewhat camouflaged robbery ship. The cockpit was made sturdier with plating, at the cost of being much more cramped, at least it has an IFF console. The cargo bay was turned into a boarding pad. FTL capable, and equipped with two frontal facing dravons.
