# Shuttle Notes: The cargo compartiment decals are cleanable, it's on purpose to let retrofitters make that cargo bay into whatever they want. 
#                The price is intended to be above the ship's actual value, to balance out the presence of an FTL drive and count the additional features on top of that.
