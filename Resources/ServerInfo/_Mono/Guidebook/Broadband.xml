  - Tracker beacons are not affected by radio range, and will be broadcasted to the entire sector.
  - All other radios, including Handheld, Binary, and Syndicate are long-range, and do not have range limits.
  - If you wish to do long range communications, a holopad or a fax machine is your best bet. Every ship should have one.
