# Conflict Rule 2
## Adhere to the new life rule.

- [color=red][bold]Do not return to the location of your death[/bold][/color] during an ongoing situation or to collect your previous life’s items.
- This rule applies only to [color=yellow]respawns[/color] (not to medical revivals or cloning).
- Treat your new life as a [color=yellow]fresh start[/color]; do not seek revenge or act on information from your previous life.

[italic][color=green]The New Life Rule helps maintain fairness and immersion by preventing players from immediately rejoining conflicts or recovering lost gear after death.[/color][/italic]
