# Conflict Rule 4
## Outpost striking is not allowed outside of certain exceptions.

Before 6 hours has passed, Faction outposts (e.g., [color=yellow]Baikal Station[/color]) are [color=red][bold]not allowed[/bold][/color] to be striked unless [color=yellow]admin permission[/color] has been given.

Faction outposts may be struck beyond the [bold]6th hour mark[/bold] freely without [color=yellow]admin permission[/color]. You are heavily encouraged to be as dramatic as possible and cooperate with your fellow faction on a portstrike, seeking approval from your commander or other commanding staff is highly encouraged beforehand.

Attacking factions are not exempt from [color=red]NLR[/color=red] while port striking, attempting to repeatedly assault a port nonstop through respawns and poor roleplay may result in administrative action.

[italic][color=yellow]This is designed to provide factions with a window to establish themselves and engage in roleplay before facing attacks.[/color][/italic]

- For clarity, a "strike" in this context refers to any (organized or unorganized) hostile action intended to damage outposts, seize control, eliminate its occupants, or damage docked ships.

See the [textlink="Safe Zones rule" link="MonolithRuleRoleplayEightSafeZones"] for areas that are always protected from strikes.

<!-- [italic][color=green]Respect the grace period to encourage fair play and allow for meaningful faction development.[/color][/italic] -->
